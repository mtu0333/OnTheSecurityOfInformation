# TCP/21 - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

 * **Difficulty** - Low hanging fruit.

FTP is the standard network protocol for tranferring files from an FTP server to an FTP client. Other variations of the protocol include:

 * **FTPS** - Encrypted FTP over TLS
 * **SFTP** - Encrypted FTP over SSH
 * **TFTP** - Trivial File Transfer Protocol

## Things to look out for

 * **Anonymous FTP** - The ability to connect to an FTP server without valid credentials. This can be done by logging in with the username 'anonymous' and an arbitrary password.


## FTP commands
