# Buffer Overflows

## Overview

A buffer overflow vulnerability occurs when an input written to memory is larger than the memory allocated to it. For example, if a buffer of 32 bytes is allocated for an input, and a value of 40 bytes is supplied to the input, then when the input is written to memory, the entore allocated memory is written and the buffer overflows to write over the next eight bytes of memory.  This effectively allows a user to alter the memory adjacent to the buffer, which typically results in incorrect program execution resulting in a crash, but if used correctly, can be exploited to run arbitrary code on the host.

## Important Registers

**ESP - Extended Stack Pointer:** The register that points to the top of the running process' stack.

**EIP - Extended Instruction Pointer:** The register that contains points to instruction currently being executed.

 ## Buffer Overflow Protections

 ## Identifying Buffer Overflows
  
 - **Code Review** - If the application code is open source, or access to the code is gained by some other means, then reviewing the code for dangerous operations can reveal buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
 
 - **Fuzzing** - Send malformed data to all inputs and observe any unexpected behaviour.
